Final report:
The 19th full 2-staged (00074/00075) training has ended! I want you to read the experiments/full_training_run/000xx/opt.json, experiments/full_training_run/000xx/checkpoints/timestamp.txt, experiments/full_training_run/000xx/miner_profile.txt for both trainings and compare them to previous trainings (from training_summary_and_commands.txt). Finally prepare a thorough report about this training and add it to training_summary_and_commands.txt.
